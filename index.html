<p> Welcome to my website! </p> 
<p> For many years I have been a huge fan of all things My Little Pony. My first introduction to the show was the 3rd generation, with DVD specials such as, <i> The Princess Promenade </i> and, my all time favourite, <i> A Very Minty Christmas. </i> It was no surprise that when My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic rolled around, I was enamoured. It quickly became my favourite show, and as a child, I made my mom 'tape' every new episode. I was amazed by <i> The Mane 6's </i> unique personalities and the epic adventures they went on. </p>
<p> I have held on to many of my figurines and DVD's, and continue to collect more on occasion. I have also continued to make art of these colourful little horses, nearly rivaling the amount I made as a child. I hope you enjoy this website as an ongoing archive of my interest. </p>
